YC00002-SDEV-ARTU,I just want a job I can leave at 5': How a generation fell out of love with work,https://financialpost.com/fp-work/how-generation-z-fell-out-of-love-work,"The article discusses the phenomenon of younger generations, particularly Generation Z, expressing a lack of interest in ambitious career paths and a desire for more work-life balance. The housing market and cost of living crisis in cities like London are cited as major factors contributing to this mindset. The high cost of living and the difficulty of saving for a mortgage make it challenging for young people to prioritize career advancement over immediate financial stability.

The article includes quotes from individuals who are experiencing work weariness and are drawn to the idea of a nine-to-five job at a big company with less pressure and the ability to leave work at a set time. They express a desire for more anonymity and the ability to focus on other aspects of life outside of work.

The author also highlights the historical pattern of older generations criticizing younger ones for their perceived lack of ambition and work ethic. Each generation has faced similar accusations, from the ""Lost Generation"" to the baby boomers to Generation X and millennials. Now, it is Generation Z's turn to face this criticism.

The article concludes by mentioning the rise of workplace microtrends among Generation Z, such as ""quiet quitting,"" ""bare minimum Mondays,"" and ""lazy girl jobs,"" which celebrate easy office work. It cites a recruitment agency's report of an increase in young people searching for undemanding but highly paid roles.

Overall, the article suggests that the current generation's attitudes towards work may be influenced by economic and societal factors, as well as a desire for a better work-life balance."

It emphasizes the importance of aligning skills demand and supply to ensure that young people are equipped with the necessary skills for future employability and fulfillment.

The report mentions that if current trends continue, a significant number of school-age children in low- and middle-income countries will not acquire the basic skills needed for the workforce. This lack of skills acquisition at an early age contributes to the skills mismatch problem faced by employees, employers, and society at large. The severity of the skills mismatch varies across regions, with a high percentage of youth, particularly women, not in education, employment, or training.

The report also highlights the global scale of the skills mismatch challenge, with over half of current employees in many countries having jobs that do not match their educational level. This calls for the involvement of businesses in addressing this issue. The opportunities for businesses to contribute to improving training and education and making them relevant to the labor market are significant. By unlocking the potential and prospects of young people, businesses can contribute to a more inclusive and prosperous society while ensuring their own long-term success.

The report suggests several steps for businesses to tackle the skills mismatch. This includes understanding the skills needed for the future, fostering a culture of continuous learning within the organization, and effectively communicating skills demands to relevant stakeholders. The report concludes by highlighting the importance of collaboration between businesses, UNICEF, and other stakeholders in empowering young people and addressing the skills mismatch."
YC00005-SDEV-VISU,Charted: Youth Unemployment in the OECD and China,https://www.visualcapitalist.com/youth-unemployment-in-oecd-and-china/,"The context provided discusses the issue of youth unemployment in various countries, particularly focusing on the OECD countries and China. It highlights the significance of tracking youth unemployment as an indicator of general opportunities within a country and its potential impact on future economic prospects. High rates of youth unemployment can lead to brain drain as young adults seek better job opportunities elsewhere. Additionally, it has the potential to cause civil unrest.

The context mentions that Spain has the highest youth unemployment rate among the OECD countries, with almost one in three young adults unable to find a job. One of the reasons cited for this is the mismatch between educational qualifications and the labor market. The reliance on temporary contracts and seasonal sectors like tourism also contributes to Spain's persistently high unemployment rate across different age groups.

Gender disparities in youth unemployment are also discussed, with young men experiencing higher unemployment rates compared to young women in most OECD countries. However, across all age groups, the unemployment rate is similar for men and women.

The context also highlights the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on youth unemployment, stating that it has worsened the situation globally. Lockdowns and restrictions have hindered young adults from accessing entry-level jobs, affecting their work experience and long-term earnings potential.

The specific case of China is mentioned, where the youth unemployment rate has significantly increased, reaching 21.3% in June 2023. This rise is attributed to the country's economic slowdown. As a result, the Chinese government has suspended age-specific unemployment data for the near future.

In contrast, Japan has a low youth unemployment rate of 4.2%, primarily due to its shrinking and aging population, which has created a tight labor market.

Overall, the context emphasizes the importance of addressing youth unemployment and understanding its causes and consequences for individuals and economies."
YC00006-SDEV-SUMU,Calgary's Skills Development Framework,https://www.learningcity.ca/the-five-key-insights,"The given context highlights the need for Calgary's learning system to adapt to the demands of an ever-changing labor market. Employers now require individuals with the capacity to learn faster and better, in order to thrive in times of uncertainty. However, the current learning system is not optimized to meet these demands. Developing adaptive capacity has become a critical community priority.

For decades, Calgary's labor market was focused on the oil & gas industry, prioritizing job skills and offering high compensation. However, this legacy has resulted in a significant gap between the skills required in the current labor market and those possessed by the workforce. Transitioning the learning system to meet these emerging demands requires collaboration and harmonization across the entire system.

Calgary also faces barriers to creating an inclusive labor market, including cultural and hiring practice barriers. Strategies must be adopted to unlock and develop the potential of all individuals to prosper in a diversified economy. Currently, only 20 percent of executive positions in Calgary are held by women, the lowest among major cities.

Furthermore, there are barriers limiting innovation in the learning system, ranging from infrastructure to culture. To stimulate innovation, strategies should be implemented to accelerate collaboration and competition.

Overall, the Calgary Skills Development Framework, developed through community engagement and research, identifies five key insights: the need for community-level leadership to align priorities and resources, the demand for adaptive capacity, the recognition of the legacy in the labor market, the barriers to an inclusive labor market, and the barriers limiting system innovation. These insights serve as a guide for improving and transforming Calgary's learning system."
YC00008-SDEV-ARTU,Community-Centered Innovation and Practice: What will it take to make science and technology truly equitable?,https://sciencepolicyconference.ca/posts/community-centered-innovation-and-practice-what-will-it-take-to-make-science-and-technology-truly-equitable/,"The given context highlights the need for revamping science culture and revising decision-making processes to ensure meaningful engagement of marginalized communities. While interventions that facilitate access and participation are important, they alone are not enough. Marginalized communities must see alignment with their experiences and perspectives, as well as have substantive opportunities to shape and leverage science for the benefit of their communities.

To achieve this, there is a need to reorganize science standards, leadership, and management. This includes shifting away from economic growth and global competitiveness as the primary markers of success, and prioritizing social and environmental benefits and genuine collaboration. Community efforts require support at institutional, policy, and systems levels.

Education and informal learning play a crucial role in developing broader science literacy. Effective, relevant, and culturally-affirming science and technology education is needed in formal school systems, as well as informal learning opportunities.

Partners and collaborators are also important in strengthening community-led initiatives. Trusted organizations can provide auxiliary support with capacity, resources, connection, and subject matter expertise. Examples include ScienceUpFirst, which partners with community groups to tackle misinformation, and the African Canadian Services Branch of the Nova Scotia Department of Education, which collaborates with education stakeholders to facilitate access to quality learning opportunities for African Canadian students.

The inaccessibility of science and innovation among marginalized communities leads to alienation, mistrust, and discomfort with adopting new research and technology. This results in important perspectives being overlooked, and a lack of broad relevance in research and technology. It is crucial to address these issues through community-level initiatives and investments to build trust and participation in science."

It highlights notable differences in outlook based on gender, with men generally having a more positive outlook than women, especially among the youngest adults. Despite the significant disruptions caused by the pandemic in terms of work and education, young Canadians in this age group have displayed remarkable stability in hopefulness and self-confidence.

The data shows that a majority of young adults feel confident in their abilities, even when faced with challenges. They also report being able to bounce back quickly after hard times and having people they can depend on for support. These positive outlooks have remained consistent over time, with figures remaining relatively stable since March 2020.

There are some regional differences in outlook, with Quebecers generally having a more positive outlook compared to other provinces. Young adults in the territories also display a particularly positive outlook, although the sample size is small. Additionally, individuals who identify as South Asian, Black, or Indigenous tend to have more positive outlooks, while those who identify as Chinese have a less positive outlook.

The context emphasizes the importance of supporting young adults during this challenging time, as they face uncertainties in education and employment. It suggests that governments, educational institutions, and employers should adopt measures that take into account the unique experiences and needs of this age cohort to prevent them from falling through the cracks and to ensure their long-term success."
YC00013-SDEV-ARTU,Skills Training for Youth,https://fsc-ccf.ca/blog-skills-training-for-youth/,"The context provided highlights the challenges faced by youth in accessing training programs that align with the skills needed for success in the job market. It states that a significant percentage of employers believe that youth are not adequately prepared to meet the demands of the emerging job market. To address this issue, it is suggested that training programs for youth should prioritize essential skills such as adaptability, collaboration, communication, digital literacy, problem-solving, and creativity.

However, the data shows that the type of training completed by youth does not align with the skills they believe are necessary for career success. Only a small percentage of youth have received training in areas like management, leadership, and communication. This mismatch between the skills needed and the training provided calls for further exploration and consideration of the employer's role in supporting relevant training opportunities.

The context also emphasizes the importance of the skills development landscape in addressing the skills gaps. While youth value essential skills, the survey indicates that only 55% of organizations serving youth provide skills training connected to foundational skills.

In response to skills gaps, industry leaders, including government, businesses, academia, and skills organizations, need to reconsider their approach to engaging youth. It is suggested that there is a shift from traditional credential-based training systems to ones that focus on skills development and work-integrated learning. This shift recognizes that skills and abilities should not be solely diploma-oriented but should align with labor demands."
YC00014-SDEV-REPP,"A Rosetta Stone for Noncognitive Skills
Understanding, Assessing, and Enhancing Noncognitive Skills in Primary and Secondary Education",https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277476500_A_Rosetta_Stone_for_Noncognitive_Skills_Understanding_Assessing_and_Enhancing_Noncognitive_Skills_in_Primary_and_Secondary_Education/link/556b895508aec22683037b4e/download,"The context provided discusses the importance of noncognitive skills in the workforce and the need for an evidence-based framework to teach and assess these skills in primary and secondary education. The report commissioned by a consortium of organizations identified ethic, teamwork, oral communication, leadership, creativity, and life-long learning as the most sought-after skills by employers. However, these skills were found lacking in new employees joining the workforce.

The paper proposes a framework that includes problem-solving, critical thinking, collaboration, agility, adaptability, initiative, entrepreneurship, effective communication, accessing and analyzing information, curiosity, and imagination.

YC00026-SDEV-OPIU,COVID-19 Q&A: Dr. Lawrence Fung on Impacts on the Neurodiverse Community,https://med.stanford.edu/psychiatry/about/covid19/neurodiverse.html,"The given context discusses the impact of COVID-19 on the neurodiverse community and offers recommendations for minimizing its effects. It begins by acknowledging the prolonged nature of the pandemic and the anxiety it will continue to cause in the coming years. Many companies have already announced that employees will work from home until 2021, prompting the adaptation of projects and events to virtual formats. For instance, the Stanford Neurodiversity Project will host its upcoming summit virtually, allowing for a wider audience and the inclusion of distinguished speakers from around the world. Additionally, a virtual Neurodiversity high school camp has been launched to continue supporting neurodiverse individuals.

However, a concern is the potential funding cuts for disabilities, as many states are proposing budget cuts in various areas. This is worrisome given the higher case-fatality rates found among COVID-19 patients with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). The statistics highlight the need for increased funding to support individuals with IDD, including autism.

In terms of employment, prior to the pandemic, the unemployment or underemployment rate among adults on the autism spectrum was estimated to be around 80%. With the economic downturn caused by the pandemic, job losses are expected to disproportionately affect individuals with disabilities. A previous study conducted during the 2008 recession showed that job losses among workers with disabilities were significantly higher than those without disabilities.

Overall, the context emphasizes the importance of continuing progress in embracing the skills and talents of neurodiverse individuals, while also addressing the challenges posed by the pandemic, such as funding cuts and employment disparities."
YC00027-SDEV-RESP,Remote Work and Employment Dynamics under COVID-19: Evidence from Canada,https://www.utpjournals.press/doi/full/10.3138/cpp.2020-026,"The given context is from a research article that focuses on the impact of remote work on employment dynamics during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. The article aims to estimate the feasibility of working from home and examine the heterogeneity of this variable across different dimensions. 

The authors use labor microdata to identify various characteristics of workers who are less likely to have jobs that can be done remotely. These characteristics include being poorer, male, without a college degree, working in the private sector, single, employed in small firms, seasonal or contractual workers, part-time workers, younger, and non-immigrant workers. They find that these workers experienced larger employment losses between March and April 2020.

The authors also measure the percentage of jobs that can be performed remotely using the methodology developed by Dingel and Neiman (2020) and applied to other countries. They find that 41% of jobs in Canada can be done remotely, with significant variation across provinces, cities, and industries.

The article highlights the importance of considering productivity or output instead of just jobs when studying the impact of remote work. It also suggests that the impact of policy measures, such as the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, should be studied.

The replication package for the research project is available on GitHub, and the authors acknowledge the contributions of various individuals and organizations to the study. The context concludes with a reference to the full article for further details."
YC00028-SDEV-ARTU,"Gen Z lack workplace skills like debating and seeing different points of view because they spend too much time on social media, TV boss says",https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-z-lacking-workplace-skills-social-media-channel-4-boss-2023-9,"The CEO of British network Channel 4, Alex Mahon, recently blamed social media for the lack of communication skills among Gen Z workers. Mahon made these remarks during a conference with the Royal Television Society in Cambridge. According to research commissioned by Channel 4, young people in the UK watch over five hours of video content daily, with short-form content being their preferred choice.

The study also revealed that short-form content accounted for 25% of total video consumption among older individuals, but rose to 45% for those between the ages of 16 and 34. However, this increased exposure to short-form content has been associated with a feeling of being out of control. Mahon stated that when algorithms determine what content users see, they experience a fleeting dopamine hit that quickly fades, leaving them feeling empty.

The concerns about Gen Z's communication skills have been exacerbated by the pandemic, which forced young people to rely heavily on virtual communication tools for studying and working remotely. As a result, they may not have had sufficient opportunities to develop authentic in-person communication skills.

Mahon emphasized that young workers often lack the ability to engage in debates or disagreements, which are essential skills in the workplace. Social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube, known for creating echo chambers that reinforce users' existing beliefs, were specifically mentioned as contributing to this issue.

In response to these concerns, companies like KPMG, PWC, and Deloitte have started offering communication classes to recent graduates, focusing on office etiquette, teamwork, presentations, and professional attire.

Overall, the research suggests that the heavy consumption of short-form content and the echo chamber effect of social media platforms have hindered Gen Z's ability to effectively communicate and engage in debates, potentially posing challenges in the workplace."
YC00029-SDEV-RESP,"Remote Work across Jobs, Companies, and Space",https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w31007/w31007.pdf,"The context provided discusses a study that aims to analyze the shift towards remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic using job vacancy postings. Traditional methods of quantifying and characterizing this shift rely on surveys, but this study utilizes the information contained in over 250 million job postings from five English-speaking countries.

To develop their language-processing model, the researchers apply state-of-the-art methods to analyze the text in the job postings and determine if the job allows for remote work. They also use human readings to generate 30,000 classifications that are used to train a machine learning algorithm. The resulting model, called the Working-from-Home Algorithmic Measure (WHAM) model, achieves a 99% accuracy rate in classifying jobs that allow for remote work.

The study highlights that the interaction of words with surrounding context determines the overall meaning of sentences. For example, the word ""remote"" can have different meanings depending on the context in which it is used.

The agreement rate among workers in classifying job postings as positive or negative for remote work is discussed. The majority of examples are unanimous negative or positive, with a small percentage having a dissenting vote. It is noted that only 29.2% of the job postings receive a majority of positive votes.

Overall, the study emphasizes the use of job vacancy postings as a valuable source of information to understand the shift towards remote work, providing detailed text data at a large scale. The WHAM model proves to be highly accurate in classifying job postings, outperforming other methods."

City developers have focused on one- and two-bedroom units, which limits housing options for families. This is due to higher profits and regulatory constraints. To reverse this trend, political will is needed. The aging population and labor shortages will also shape the future of cities. Employers will have to cater to the desires of a smaller young workforce, which may include a mix of remote work and in-person mentorship. Aging populations may also be drawn to cities for better healthcare, services, walkability, and cultural opportunities.

Downtown areas will need to evolve beyond office spaces. The traditional central business district is becoming outdated, and cities will need to concentrate on creating spaces that facilitate commercial, cultural, and civic activities. Despite challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic, cities will remain attractive because people are hard-wired to gather and cluster in urban areas. Overall, cities must adapt and implement policies that attract residents, families, and businesses to thrive in the future."
YC00068-CITY-ARTU,"Downtowns are in decline, leading to the rise of â€˜donut citiesâ€™",https://www.fastcompany.com/90937633/downtowns-are-in-decline-leading-to-the-rise-of-donut-cities,"Cities across the United States, including San Jose, are facing financial challenges and the potential for urban decline. With limited financial resources and constrained budgets, cities are struggling to meet the demands of their residents. This situation is exacerbated by the fact that cities are now in competition with each other for residents, businesses, and funding. Without adequate resources, cities may experience a decline similar to what was seen in the 20th century.

The outlook for cities largely depends on how residents and businesses react to these challenges. The U.S. Census Bureau reported that San Jose lost 42,000 residents in 2022, indicating a decline in population. This trend, along with the strain on city finances, could lead to a ""Donut City"" scenario where the city center loses residents and businesses to the suburbs.

One major issue facing cities like San Jose is homelessness. Despite efforts to address the problem by investing in affordable housing and counseling services, the unhoused population continues to grow. The debate over the city's budget revolves around finding solutions to this growing crisis, but new funds are hard to come by. Raising taxes could have negative consequences, such as declining consumer spending and sales tax revenue.

In conclusion, cities in the United States are grappling with financial constraints, population decline, and the pressing issue of homelessness. The future of these cities will depend on their ability to find creative solutions with limited resources and the willingness of residents and businesses to support their communities."
YC00069-CITY-RESP,Reconsidering the Conceptualization of Resilience: The Experiences of Refugee and Immigrant Youth in Montreal.,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11482-023-10154-3,"The provided context describes a research study focused on the resilience and integration experiences of young immigrants in Montreal. The study involved 15 participants, with 11 of them identifying as women. The larger proportion of female participants was seen as beneficial for the research, as it would make the findings more relatable to women who often face more socio-economic challenges. The study aimed to contribute to a better understanding of resilience by considering the lived experiences and struggles of young immigrants within their socio-political and cultural environment.

The objectives of the research were twofold: firstly, to explore how resilience is conceptualized by young immigrants, and secondly, to identify and assess barriers to their resilience in the integration process. The literature review highlighted that young refugees are considered a vulnerable population due to psychological problems and the challenges they face in adapting to a new society.

One aspect of resilience mentioned by the respondents was the ability to integrate into the host society while maintaining one's own cultural identity. The participants emphasized the importance of understanding and embracing the new culture while staying connected to their own heritage.

The research methodology involved in-depth interviews conducted virtually using online platforms. The interviews lasted between 60 and 120 minutes, and detailed information about the study and consent procedures was provided to the participants. The data analysis followed a manual inductive thematic approach, where patterns in the data were identified and categorized to form analytical themes.

Overall, this research aimed to contribute to the understanding of resilience among young immigrants in Montreal and identify potential barriers to their integration process."

It highlights the challenges of population distribution and the impact it has on various countries. The article emphasizes that some regions have an excess of old people, while others have an abundance of young people. Opening borders and allowing greater migration is suggested as a solution to this issue, but it is hindered by the rise of right-wing populist movements.

The World Bank predicts that Asian countries will experience rapid aging, surpassing the aging process that took France over 100 years and the United States over 60 years in just 20 years. Japan is highlighted as a particularly old country, and Europe is also facing an aging population. By 2050, most of today's richest countries will have aged populations, while others will have a large working-age population for the first time.

The article also touches upon the economic implications of these demographic changes. Historically, dominant powers have benefited from large working-age populations that drive economic growth. However, limited resources in developing countries are often directed towards raising children, limiting economic opportunities. The economic logic of age is acknowledged as a challenge that is difficult to overcome.

In summary, the world is undergoing a vast demographic shift, with aging populations in some regions and a surplus of young people in others. This will impact countries' economic growth and necessitate changes in policies and migration patterns."

",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43576-022-00043-4,"The given context describes a research study evaluating the effectiveness of the Neighborhood Youth Violence Reduction Program (NYVRP) in Indigenous communities in Canada. The study utilized qualitative data analysis techniques, such as thematic analysis, to analyze survey responses and interview data. The purpose of the study was to understand the perceptions of community youth regarding self-reported crime rates and trust in the police.

The findings from the descriptive analysis of the community youth survey highlighted the need for the NYVRP in the communities. The study suggests that the outcomes of the NYVRP should be interpreted in conjunction with other programs and initiatives at various levels of government, as well as best practices in Indigenous policing from other countries.

The federal government has made significant investments in the safety and security of Indigenous communities in recent years. The study emphasizes the importance of synthesizing the outcomes of evidence-based programs like the NYVRP with best practices from countries such as the United States, Australia, and New Zealand to develop a global understanding and framework for Indigenous policing in Canada.

The study also emphasizes the need for a community-based policing approach that addresses the specific needs of Indigenous communities, particularly those living in rural areas. This approach focuses on principles such as responsibility, accountability, and interdependency, and aims to repair the troubled history and eliminate adverse experiences between the Canadian police and Indigenous communities.

The study also discusses the thematic analysis of qualitative data gathered from program stakeholders and staff through interviews and open-ended survey questions. Themes such as friendly supervision, decreased violence, attitudes toward authority figures, and sustainability of outcomes emerged from the analysis, highlighting the impact of the NYVRP on participants' behavior and interactions with the police."

YC00074-WELL-RESP,An exploration of work life wellness and remote work during and beyond Covid-19,https://cjcd-rcdc.ceric.ca/index.php/cjcd/article/view/92/109,"The given context discusses the concept of work-life balance and its various dimensions. It starts by acknowledging that during the pandemic, factors like time, energy, strain, and cognitive conflict affect individuals' lives, regardless of whether they have a family. Work-life balance is defined as finding a balance between work and personal commitments, but it is noted that achieving a perfect balance is unrealistic and unattainable.

The term ""work-life integration"" is introduced as an alternative to work-life balance, which refers to blending work and personal life. However, the term ""work-life wellness"" is preferred in this context to focus on the positive aspects and to be inclusive of individuals who may not have a traditional family structure at home.

The concept of work-family conflict is also mentioned, which encompasses both family interference with work and work interference with family. However, this term is not used as the main construct in this paper to be more inclusive.

Overall, the context emphasizes the subjective nature of work-life balance, the need to focus on the positives, and the consideration of various factors that affect individuals' lives. It provides a justification for using the term ""work-life wellness"" and highlights the importance of addressing the interplay between work and personal commitments."

The findings of these interviews provided insights into various aspects of their lives during the pandemic. 

One significant finding was the impact on education. Many parents reported challenges with remote learning, including difficulties in engaging their children, managing behaviors, and accessing necessary supports. Students with NDD experienced increased anxiety and anger upon returning to school, as they no longer had the option to take breaks or engage in calming activities like jumping on a trampoline.

Another area affected by the pandemic was employment. Parents and caregivers faced job losses, reduced work hours, and inadequate work opportunities due to increased caregiving responsibilities. Balancing work-from-home and caregiving became particularly challenging for employed parents, leading to financial burdens.

The researchers emphasized the importance of inclusive and family-centered approaches in recovery and future policy development. They highlighted the need for decision-makers to address participation barriers during public health emergencies and prioritize the well-being of families and children with NDD.

The study was supported and funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and Kids Brain Health Network.

The study explores the relationship between work settings during the COVID-19 pandemic and self-rated mental health. The authors conducted a survey called the Canadian Social Connection Survey (CSCS) and obtained funding from various sources including the Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR) and the Genwell Project.

The authors acknowledge the limitations of their study, particularly in terms of measurement. They suggest that future studies should use more comprehensive measures of mental health, such as specific measures of anxiety and depression. They also mention the possibility of using short scales like the PHQ-2 and GAD-2 in large surveys to assess mental health.

The study sample mainly consisted of individuals working in hybrid arrangements (working both from home and in-person), which may not be representative of the wider Canadian workforce. The authors caution against interpreting the results in relation to specific psychological disorders due to the limitations of the dataset.

The study found that the majority of participants reported positive self-rated mental health, but those not working from home had a higher proportion of negative self-rated mental health. The demographic characteristics of the sample were also described, including age, gender, race, income, and education level.

The study did not include questions about individuals' worry about COVID-19 exposure at work or workplace protection protocols, which limits the assessment of psychological distress related to the pandemic.

The participation of Indigenous youth in these spaces not only allows settler audiences to learn about First Nations culture but also reveals the realities of settler communities to the Indigenous youth.

Speaking in public and sharing their stories can transform relationships and challenge power dynamics. Moments of genuine connection and respect, where audience members approach the participants to show their respect, demonstrate a temporary unsettling of power relations. However, the Indigenous youth still face challenges of misunderstanding, false representations, anger, and fear. Some participants have experienced insults and hurtful comments from individuals they have encountered, even if those individuals had good intentions. Despite these challenges, the young video makers involved in the project believe in the value of these encounters and the importance of understanding each other's perspectives.

Overall, the context highlights the active participation of Indigenous youth in bridging the gap between Indigenous and settler communities, the importance of centering their voices and experiences, and the challenges they face in these efforts."

These trends are important for both employers and employees to stay competitive in the constantly evolving job market.

One of the key trends is the focus on mental health. Companies are recognizing the importance of promoting mental health in the workplace as employees face stress and burnout. Providing resources such as flexible work arrangements and employee assistance programs can support mental health and lead to increased job satisfaction and innovation.

Another trend is the empowerment of non-traditional workers, such as gig workers and freelancers. These workers are playing an increasingly important role in the workforce, and companies are offering them the support and resources they need to succeed.

Personalized learning and development is also becoming critical. Tailoring learning programs to meet the individual needs and goals of employees not only helps them achieve personal and professional growth, but also benefits the company through increased engagement and productivity.

YC00105-TRND-ARTU,12 Workplace Trends to Expect in 2023,https://emeritus.org/blog/the-future-of-work-workplace-trends/,"In the evolving workplace of 2023, hiring practices are shifting towards focusing on specific skills rather than previous roles. Companies are recognizing the value of skills like data analysis that can be applied across various positions. As a result, alternative credential programs like short courses and certificates are gaining popularity for hiring purposes, and companies are investing in in-house upskilling efforts.

Workforce transformation has been accelerated by factors such as the pandemic, and employers must prioritize skills development to keep up. Upskilling and reskilling employees to meet current business needs is essential.

Employee well-being is becoming a significant concern for companies as work stress and benefits/flexibility issues contribute to turnover. Prioritizing employee happiness and health through additional benefits, flexibility, sign-on bonuses, and positive workplace experiences can yield significant benefits.

Talent shortages are posing challenges for hiring, with many companies struggling to find qualified applicants for critical positions. This shortage is evident across industries, from construction to tech.

Soft skills, also known as power skills, have become even more important in the workplace due to virtual relationships and reduced oversight. Skills like management, leadership, critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving are in high demand. Companies will reassess their leadership models and the necessary skills for success.

Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts remain a priority for organizations in 2023. These efforts are crucial for employee engagement and recruitment, as a lack of commitment to DEI can lead to employees considering quitting their jobs.

Overall, the workplace trends in 2023 emphasize skills-based hiring, upskilling, employee well-being, talent shortages, soft skills, and DEI efforts."

Firstly, it emphasizes the importance of addressing critical aspects of work such as acquiring and retaining talent, supporting employees holistically, and ethically using employee data. Organizations that are able to do so will position themselves as employers of choice.

One significant challenge highlighted is the struggle that managers face in balancing employee expectations with performance pressure from senior leaders. Managers play a crucial role in connecting employees to company culture, but they need support and training to bridge the widening skills gap and clarify their priorities.

Another trend is the pursuit of nontraditional candidates to expand talent pipelines. As employees increasingly follow non-linear career paths, organizations need to adapt their sourcing methods and assess candidates based on the skills required for the role, rather than relying solely on credentials and prior experience.

The context also acknowledges the impact of the pandemic on the workforce, with burned-out employees and a competitive talent landscape. Organizations will need to prioritize healing pandemic trauma and creating sustainable performance to address these challenges.

Overall, the context emphasizes the need for organizations to proactively address these trends and challenges in order to succeed in the evolving work environment. This includes redesigning managerial roles, expanding talent pipelines, and prioritizing employee well-being and performance."
YC00107-TRND-ARTP,"Meet Generation Z: The second generation within the giant ""Millennial"" cohort",http://grupespsichoterapija.lt/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Gen-Z-Whitepaper.pdf,"The context provided discusses the differences in attitudes and behaviors among young people entering the workforce who were born in the 1990s compared to previous generations. These individuals have been shaped by a decade of war and economic uncertainty, leading to lower expectations, cautious confidence, and modest demands. They have experienced significant changes in technology, such as the rise of wireless internet and handheld devices, which has influenced their upbringing.

The 9/11 terrorist attacks occurred when these individuals were eleven years old, and they graduated from high school in 2008 during the economic recession. Now, as they graduate from college, they face a stumbling job market. They have grown up in a world of constant connectivity and access to information, but also experience isolation and scheduling to an unprecedented degree. This has resulted in a unique combination of growing up too fast and not growing up at all.

The mindset of the previous generation, known as Generation Y, was shaped by the thriving ethos of the 1990s, characterized by high expectations, self-confidence, and an abundance of suggestions and requests. However, the current generation entering the workforce has been shaped by a decade of war and high unemployment rates, leading to a more skeptical and cautious outlook.

The context raises the question of whether the shifts in economics, geopolitics, technology, and parenting from the 1990s to the 2000s have created distinct generational differences. It also highlights the challenges faced by young people in the job market, particularly in competition with older individuals."

The Transformation of the Workerâ€“Firm Relationship and Trends in Job Tenure Duration and Separations in Canada, 1976â€“2015",https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09500170221146916,"The context provided discusses the contradiction in the literature regarding job stability and insecurity in the labor market. The flexibilization literature suggests that there has been an increase in precarious work, job insecurity, and boundaryless careers. However, there seems to be little evidence of change in job stability. To address this contradiction, the researchers used a research design that examined two measures of instability simultaneously, estimated retention rates over a longer period, and accounted for sociodemographic shifts and economic fluctuations that may influence job stability.

The flexibilization literature emerged in the late 1980s and focused on inter-firm mobility and job loss as key career processes. It documented changing firm practices towards greater numerical flexibility and market-based practices for human resources management. This shift was a response to structural transformations in the economy.

By the 2000s, there was an accumulation of evidence suggesting that the labor market was marked by job insecurity and the emergence of new career models, such as the boundaryless career model. These models encouraged voluntary inter-firm mobility. Based on this evidence, the flexibilization literature predicted an increase in job instability throughout workers' careers.

The researchers' study supports the flexibilization literature by providing evidence of increased job instability. However, it also highlights the contrasting views within the flexibilization literature. While research on precarious work and boundaryless careers depict transformative changes in the labor market, there is still a lack of evidence regarding changes in job stability. Overall, the study aims to resolve these contradictions and provide a clearer understanding of job stability and insecurity in the labor market."
